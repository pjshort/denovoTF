Title: Predict TF binding and change in binding affinity for de novo non-coding mutations.
Version: 1.0
Date: 2015-05-14
Author: Patrick Short
Maintainer: <pjs90@cam.ac.uk>
Description: Scan a list of (human) de novo mutations and return all predicted binding motifs containing the de novo
and the change in binding affinity as a result of the de novo. Optionally, use the mutated sequence to scan for 'gain of function' TF binding.
